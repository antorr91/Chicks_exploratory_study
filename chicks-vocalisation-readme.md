# Exploratory Analysis of Early-Life Chick Calls

This repository contains the code and documentation for our study on early-life chick (*Gallus gallus*) vocalizations. Our research aims to develop a computational framework for the automatic detection and feature extraction of chick calls, with applications in behavioral studies and vocal interactive systems.

## Abstract

Animal calls are crucial for communication and key indicators of animal welfare. Early-life chick (*Gallus gallus*) calls are vital for hen-chick interactions and reveal their affective states. However, automated detection and recognition systems for chick vocalizations are lacking. Previous studies have identified various call types linked to internal states, but existing models lack systematic validation and are prone to human bias.

To address this gap, we developed a computational framework for the automatic detection and feature extraction of chick calls. Using these features, we analyzed the calls of one-day-old chicks using various soft and hard clustering techniques to determine whether distinct categories or a continuous spectrum better characterize their repertoire.

## Methods

1. **Data Collection**: 31 audio recordings of individual chicks from two experimental setups.
2. **Preprocessing**: Normalization and bandpass filtering.
3. **Onset and Offset Detection**: Evaluated various algorithms for detecting call boundaries.
4. **Feature Extraction**: Extracted 26 features including time-domain, frequency-domain, and time-frequency domain characteristics.
5. **Clustering Analysis**: Tested five clustering techniques (K-means, Fuzzy C-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering).
6. **Sex Classification**: Employed Random Forest for feature selection, followed by SVM and Decision Tree for classification.

## Key Findings

1. The High Frequency Content (HFC) algorithm performed best for onset detection (F1 = 0.85).
2. First-order energy difference combined with local minimum detection was most effective for offset detection (F1 = 0.94).
3. Clustering analysis suggested an optimal division of the dataset into two or three clusters.
4. UMAP visualization revealed potential continuous spectrum in the chicks' vocal repertoire.
5. Sex classification based on extracted features performed below chance level, indicating the need for further research.

## Future Work

This study serves as a proof of concept for developing algorithms for automatic feature extraction and unsupervised analysis of early-life chick calls.
